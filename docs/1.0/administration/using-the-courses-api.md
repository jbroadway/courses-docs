# Using the Courses API

The Courses API is designed around Elefant's [Model](http://api.elefantcms.com/visor/lib/Model)
class, which provides a consistent abstraction around storing and retrieving
info from the database.

All of the available objects live in the `apps/courses/models` folder. The API
documentation is still a work in progress, but all methods are documented in
DocBlock-style comments in those PHP files.

A RESTful API is also available for many of the functions of the LMS, however
the documentation for third party integration hasn't yet been written.

Since Courses is an open source project, developers are encouraged to help fill in areas
where the documentation is missing or incomplete by clicking the `Edit this page`
link below.
