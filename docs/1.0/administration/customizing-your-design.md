# Customizing your design theme

The design of your website can be modified by editing the HTML and CSS
files in the `layouts` folder, either directly or via the Tools > Designer
screen in the CMS.

The HTML files use a simple template language that allows you to
specify where the title or page body should go, as well as a number
of more powerful design features.

The default theme is found in `layouts/default.html` and you'll see it's very
concise and easily readable for a design template.
