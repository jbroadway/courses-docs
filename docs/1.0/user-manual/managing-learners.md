# Managing learners

Learners are ordinary members of your site that are subscribed to one or more
courses. Any Elefant user account can be a learner.

To manually add user accounts, log in as an administrator and go to Tools > Users
then click the `Add User` link. From here you can visit Tools > Courses and click
on the `Learners` link for a course to add your new users to that course.

To add a user to an existing course, visit Tools > Courses and click on the
`Learners` link next to the course. This will bring up the current list of
learners for that course.

Click on `Add Learner` which will open the `Choose a User` dialog window, then
click on any user to add them to the course. If a user is already in the course,
their name will appear grayed out and will not be clickable.

> Tip: You can add a new user account directly in the `Choose a User` dialog by
> clicking the `Add User` link. This saves you having to visit Tools > Users
> first if you're only adding one or two learners to a course.

## Instructors

The instructor of a course is set in the course settings. A course may have only
one instructor, but by default any admin user can access the course editor and
learner assessments too.
