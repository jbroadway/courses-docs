# Embedding external content

To embed external content into a page in your course, first open the page
you wish to change in the page editor.

To add embedded content, choose the `HTML code` object type from the left
sidebar. You can give your embed an optional title, then paste the HTML
from the 3rd party site into the text box.

You can embed any HTML code into a page in this way, including YouTube
videos, embedded chat boxes, games, widgets, or pretty much anything.

## Security considerations 

When you embed HTML code from 3rd parties, it is a potential security
risk to your users. Make sure you paste HTML code only from trusted
3rd parties.

Also note that PHP code will not run within embedded content, however
JavaScript code will run.
