# Managing discussions

Discussions are found in the comments at the bottom of each page of
a course. Each page has its own comments, so that the discussion
can focus on the topics in the page itself.

Each comment made will trigger an email notification to the course
instructor, with a link to the page its on so you can quickly reply
to questions from learners.

Instructors can also log in and view all of the comments on the site
under Tools > Comments. Comments that are inappropriate can be rejected
by clicking the `Reject` link next to a comment on this screen.

Under Tools > Comments > Settings, you can also enable comment moderation
and specify a global moderator's email address.
