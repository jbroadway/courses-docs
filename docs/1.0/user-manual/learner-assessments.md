# Learner assessments

To view a learner's answers for a course, go to Tools > Courses and click on the
`Learners` link for that course. Next, click on the `Details` link next to
that user in the list. The details page shows all of the questions in the course
with their answers and a feedback box for the instructor to send feedback via
email to the learner for each of their answers.

Uncompleted questions will show `Not yet completed` in place of an answer, and
questions with correct answers will be marked either `(correct)` or `(incorrect)`.

Once feedback has been submitted for an answer, the feedback form will disappear
for that question and the feedback will appear saved under their answer.
