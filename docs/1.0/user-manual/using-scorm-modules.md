# Using SCORM modules

To install a SCORM module, go to Tools > SCORM in the admin toolbar.
Upload the SCORM module as a Zip file and click the `Install` button.

The list of installed SCORM modules will also appear on this screen.

To use a SCORM module in your course, first open the page you wish
to change in the page editor.

To add the SCORM module, choose the `SCORM module` object type from
the left sidebar. The list of installed modules will appear as a
drop down box. Select the module to be shown, and optionally enter
a description.
